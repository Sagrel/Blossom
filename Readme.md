# What is this repo?

One of my dreams is to create my own programming language, and I have made some attempts before (you can find them in my profile), but they were failures (for my standard)

In this repo I plan to fully specify the blossom language ðŸŒ¸! I want to have a complete specification and set of tests before writing a single line of code.
My hope is that having a target goal and a set of tests that work as progress trackers and a TODO list, I will be able to make steady progress on it this time ðŸ¤ž
