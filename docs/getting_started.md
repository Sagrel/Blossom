# Getting started

If you want to get started with Blossom, you just need to download the blossom compiler from the github repo.

Once you have the compiler, you should be able to create a `main.ðŸŒ¸` file, write `print("Hello world!")` in it and run the `blossom run main.ðŸŒ¸` command.

Congratulations! You just wrote your first blossom program, so let's move on tho the next step

# A bit more complex now
